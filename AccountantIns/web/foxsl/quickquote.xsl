												An accountant took on a new individual client, who had
												been on
												extension and not filed her federal returns for a few
												years.
												 The
												client made the accountant aware of the fact that
												she was due a
												refund from the IRS for the overpayment of
												estimated taxes a
												few years back, but she was not precise
												about exactly the
												year
												involved or the circumstances of the
												amount due back to the
												client.  Once the accountant was able
												to straighten out the
												situation and bring the client’s tax
												filings up to date, he
												applied
												for a refund of the previous
												overpayment, telling the client
												that
												the overpayment would be
												refunded by the IRS because he was
												making the request within
												three years of the due date of the
												relevant tax return.  Such
												overpayment was confiscated by the
												IRS, however, because the
												relevant tax return was filed more
												than two years after the
												overpayment was withheld.  As such
												two-year deadline was
												within the period of retention of the
												accountant, and expired
												while the accountant was otherwise
												bringing the client up to
												date, the client made a claim
												against
												the accountant for the
												amount that was confiscated by the IRS.
												 The claim was
												settled
												by payment of the amount of the
												confiscated
												overpayment.

								The accountant was retained in 2000 to prepare corporate
								income and
								payroll tax filings
								for a New Jersey corporation, with
								all services performed in New
								Jersey and a small
								percentage of its
								product being sold in New York.  In 2000, the client
								asked the
								accountant randomly by email whether it owed any sales tax to
								the
								state of
								New York.
								 While the accountant was not involved in
								any of
								the sales tax
								preparation by the client,
								which handled all
								of its
								own sales tax issues through its internal
								accounting
								department,
								the accountant responded in writing that the client
								owed no sales
								tax to New York.  After
								2004, the client began to
								increase its
								sales in the state of New York,
								opening a small New
								York satellite
								office.  In 2014, the client advised the
								accountant
								that the state
								of New York
								had just assessed back sales
								tax to the year 2004,
								along with
								substantial penalties and
								interest, because the client
								had never paid any sales tax to the
								state of
								New York.  The
								accountant took the position that it had
								no involvement in the
								client’s
								sales tax issues, and
								that it was a
								complete surprise that
								the client had not paid sales
								tax to New
								York.  The
								client,

								from the accountant to the
								client constituted
								sales tax advice, and
								created a continuing
								duty
								by the accountant
								to advise the client about whether it would
								become liable for New
								York sales tax, particularly once the
								accountant became aware of
								the
								opening of the
								client’s New York
								office.

								An accounting firm was engaged to audit the financial
								statements of
								a small independent
								school in Colorado, during a
								year
								when the school was also kicking off
								a major renovation.
								 The
								renovation was to be funded through a capital campaign and a $4

								local bank.  The engagement was difficult
								from
								the start, because the
								school’s CFO was
								uncooperative.
								 However,
								the accounting firm partner did not bring the

								encountered to the attention of her superiors at
								her firm, or to
								the
								attention of the school’s

								 The accounting
								firm issued an unqualified audit
								opinion, and the
								capital
								campaign
								was a quick success.  In addition, the local bank
								issued the
								loan
								based upon the
								school’s audited financials.
								However, 8 months
								later the CFO was found to
								have embezzled
								a
								significant amount of
								money from the loan proceeds, and to have
								misrepresented the
								financial health of the school to the
								accounting firm in order
								for the

								opinion to be
								issued.  Shortly
								thereafter, a claim was made against the
